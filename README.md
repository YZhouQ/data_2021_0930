## About data_2021_0930

We have built this repository to store operational data about our reciprocating-screw injection molding machine at HKUST's Advanced Materials Laboratory.
The data can be used for modeling, control, fault detection, data analysis, and quality optimization. etc. 

Please cite our following papers when using this data.
